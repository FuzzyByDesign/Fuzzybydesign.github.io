***TO DO LIST***

- Combine all fish king markdown files into just 1 for simplicity somehow?
- mailing list?
- add comments ability?
- fix comic viewer resizing bug. I can make the comic viewer smaller by reducing the window size, but not bigger. If the window size is initially smaller and I increase it, the comic viewer does not get bigger.
