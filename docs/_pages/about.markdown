<b> The Fish King </b> is a goofy take on the Arthurian legends, 
equally inspired by <u> The Once and Future King </u> by T.H. White
and <u> Calvin and Hobbes </u> by Bill Watterson. It follows King Arthur
and two of his best knights, Gawain and Yvain, as they go out into 
Camelot looking for a quest that will help Arthur get over his 
disastrous break up with Queen Guinevere. Unlike most comic
strips, The Fish King is story driven and is best read in publishing order. 

<b> Fuzzy </b> (that's me!) is a Boston-based comic artist who daylights
as an engineer. When Fuzzy isn't making comics, he's baking bread, knitting
sweaters, and stressing about not making enough comics.
